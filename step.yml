  Upload Gradle Dependencies
summary: |
  Uploads gradle dependencies to Github Dependency Graph
description: |
  This step uses the Github Dependency Graph Gradle plugin in order to generate a comprehensive dependency
  graph for this project, and uploads it to Github using the Github Dependency Submission REST API.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
# https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_docs/step-development-guideline.md
#
project_type_tags:
#   - ios
#   - macos
  - android
#   - xamarin
#   - react-native
#   - cordova

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.

        Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper ensures
        that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.
        You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
        and about how you can generate one
        in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
        The path should be relative to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`,
        or if it is in a sub directory, `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
